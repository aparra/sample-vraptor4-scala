sample-vraptor4-scala
=====================

Vraptor 4 + Scala + JSP view

This project is using an approach not supported by el-api. I have created a pull request to jboss-el-api_spec to add support to scala fields. If you try run this simple project, please take a look on https://github.com/aparra/jboss-el-api_spec. Of course that you need use JBoss AS and replace jar jboss-el-api_spec to use my implementation.
